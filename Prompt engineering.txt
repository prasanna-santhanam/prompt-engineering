✅ 1. Be Clear and Specific
Avoid being vague. The more detailed your prompt, the better the output.

Instead of:

Write about dogs.

Try:

Write a 150-word blog introduction about why golden retrievers make great family pets.

✅ 2. Set the Role or Style
Let the AI know who it's speaking as or the tone you want.

Example:

You're a professional chef. Explain how to make a creamy mushroom risotto in a casual tone.

✅ 3. Give Context
If the task builds on something, share background info to guide the AI.

Example:

I’m working on a landing page for a productivity app. Can you write a catchy headline and subheadline that appeal to remote workers?

✅ 4. Ask for Format
Tell the AI how you want the response — list, paragraph, table, bullet points, etc.

Example:

List 5 bullet points summarizing the benefits of meditation.

✅ 5. Use Examples (If Needed)
If you’re looking for a specific style or structure, include an example.

Example:

Write a tweet in the style of Naval Ravikant. Example: "Play long-term games with long-term people."

✅ 6. Iterate and Refine
Use follow-ups. If the first response isn’t perfect, tweak your prompt and ask again.
